# Dalia's Cookie Jar

Landing Site for my Mom's cookie business! I have yet to have anything better. Cookie and icing combo is amazing but you know it's good stuff when the "naked" cookie can hold its own.

## Technology

This is my exercise in getting more comfortable with React-Bootstrap as well as customizing it with SCSS. I would like to take a UX/UI course and flex that knowledge here first in the near future.

## Future Plans

My Dad would like for me to include his tamale-making talents in on this as well so I'll probably add a page of that just for fun. I'm lucky to have them since a lot of the fun stuff we have been able to do as a family during college was thanks to these side gigs!
